/* Class Hotel
 * ----------
 * COMP.CS.110 FALL 2025
 * ----------
 * File: hotel.hh
 * Class for describing a hotel. Only a single object created from this
 * class. Implements all commands in hotel program.
 *
 *
 * Program author
 * Name: Nabid Hasan
 * Student number: 152754330
 * Username: vmn388
 * E-Mail: nabid.hasan@tuni.fi
 *
 * Notes about the program and its implementation:
 * Header file for the Hotel class, which manages all hotel data
 * and implements all core commands (init, book, leave, prints).
 * Core data structures use smart pointers for reliable dynamic memory management.
 * Data is organized into collections to track rooms, all guests who have ever visited, and currently boarded guests.
 * A private helper function is declared to handle the complex logic required for selecting the best available room during the booking process.
